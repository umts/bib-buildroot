	  nodm is a minimal display manager that simply logs in as a given user and
	  starts an X session, without asking for username or password.
	  
	  On a normal computer, using nodm is a big security issue because it would
	  give anyone access to the computer.
	  
	  However, there are cases where automatic login is needed: for example in
	  an embedded system such as a mobile phone, or in a kiosk setup, or in a
	  control panel for industrial machinery. For those cases, nodm is simple to
	  setup, lightweight, and it should do exactly the right thing.

comment "nodm needs Xorg and a uClibc or (e)glibc toolchain w/ wchar, locale, dynamic library"
